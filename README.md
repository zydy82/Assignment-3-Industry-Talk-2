- **Reflection:**
This assignment gave me an invaluable opportunity to reflect on the relationship between academic learning and industry requirements. The speaker’s insights on the skills necessary for success in the technology sector were both eye-opening and motivating. I gained a deeper understanding of the gap that often exists between theoretical knowledge and practical expertise and how important it is to bridge this gap through both academic and extracurricular activities. Writing the report required me to reflect critically on the skills I have acquired so far and identify areas where I need to improve in order to better align with the expectations of employers in the field of computer science. Through the process, I realized the importance of continuously developing both hard and soft skills, such as coding proficiency, critical thinking, adaptability, and teamwork. This assignment prompted me to set specific personal goals for my academic journey, ensuring that I actively work toward enhancing the skills that will make me more competitive in the job market. The personal reflection also inspired me to consider further professional development opportunities and real-world experiences that would complement my university education.
